1153 - hi i decided to do the hackathon and i'm going to be building some sort of guitar pedal and using this as my brain dump blog\
1208 - originially i was considering designing just a phaser pedal, but now i'm thinking of a multi-effects pedal with some sort of switcher. Distortion, phaser, chorus/flanger, noise gate. maybe more, i'm not sure. i don't see many 3-in one pedals on the market so that could be something cool to dig into.\
1211 - oooo if it's all analog that's kinda different.\
